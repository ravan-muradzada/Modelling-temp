We are given a function f(x). and constraints gi(x).

While finding optimal solution, only at last we will determine whether the function has maximum or minimum. 

### **Steps**
1) 
![[9.png]]

We find derivative of L according to all x and all lambda.

2) Then we create boarded hessian matrix: (m is count of lambda, n is count of x) ![[10.png]]
3) Here all elements themselves are matrices. ![[11.png]]
4) To find P, we need to find derivatives of each constraint function according to each x. ![[12.png]]
5) P^T is tranpose of P.
6) To find Q:

7) Now it is time to find stationary point and classify it. ![[14.png]]

In this case we are given f(x) which is our function and constraint functions (g_i(x)). At least one from the set of constraint functions and f(x) should be linear. Both constraints and the main function should be convex. 
Actually, being linear means being convex directly.
So the hessian matrix should be either positive sem definite (convex) or positive definite (strictly convex).

## **Steps**
1) If we are given a problem where we need to find maximum of the function, after checking the things above, we need to make it min function (then we will convert it again to max). While doing that, we need to multiple each side with -1. So if we are given, a function like max(f(x)) = x1 ** 2 + x1 * x2 + x2, we need to make it min(-f(x)) = -x1 ** 2 - x1 * x2 - x2.
2) Then to be sure the convexity of constraints and and f(x), we use hessian matrix. If the result from here is psd or pd, we can say this is convex and we can continue.
3) There are four necessary conditions of the problem:

	4) After writing the correct equations for the first condition, mostly we use the second condition and take lambda or g(x) as 0. After solving the problem according to one of them, if the answer meets with all conditions, we do not need to check the other one and take this one.
	5) If we have multiple constraints, we will have:

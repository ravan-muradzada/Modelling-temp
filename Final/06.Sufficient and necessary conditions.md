##### **When it is without constraints (for both quadratic and non quadratic):**
Here Q is Hessian matrix.

##### **When it is with equality constraints (Lagrange):**
Sufficient part is creating bordered hessian matrix.

Sufficient conditions are the convexity of f(x) and g_i(x), all should be convex. At least one linear.

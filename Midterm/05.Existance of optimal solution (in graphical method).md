There are three theorems which help us to determine whether optimal solution (min or max value) do exists or not.
1) If the solution area from graphical method (feasible area) is bounded by all sides, this problem has both min and max values.
2) If the feasible area is not restricted and the variables in objective functions have positive coefficients, it has min value, but not max value.
3) If from the graph, feasible area is undefined, there is no solution.

How to find min and max of the feasible area. After finding feasible area, we will know whether it has both max and min or one of them. If the full area is surrounded, that means we have both min and max. In this case, we just need to find edge points and then put each point in objective function. From the results list, the least one is our min value and the biggest one is our max value.

If our feasible area is not surrounded by all parts, it means it has just min or max.
**How to Determine Whether It Has a Minimum or Maximum?**

To check if an unbounded feasible region has a **maximum or minimum**, follow these steps:

#### **Step 1: Identify the Objective Function Direction**

- If maximizing → Look for the **highest** possible value of the objective function.
- If minimizing → Look for the **lowest** possible value of the objective function.

#### **Step 2: Check the Feasible Region's Unbounded Direction**

- If the feasible region **extends infinitely in the direction of increasing objective function value**, then **no maximum exists**.
- If the feasible region **extends infinitely in the direction of decreasing objective function value**, then **no minimum exists**.

#### **Step 3: Test Objective Function at a Corner Point**

- If the function **increases** beyond all finite corner points, **it has no maximum**.
- If the function **decreases** beyond all finite corner points, **it has no minimum**.

If we determine that it has only min value, then we will again put the edge points on the objective function and find the results. From the results list, the smallest one is min value.

If we determine that it has only max value, then we will again put the edge points on the objective function and find the results. From the results list, the biggest one is max value.

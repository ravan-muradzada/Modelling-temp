To be able to sketch the graph of linear inequalities, we will sketch the line of equality of this.
If we want  to sketch the graph of `2x + 3y > 12`, first we should sketch `2x + 3y = 12`.
Then we will look at the point upper of this line, if when we put the coordinate of this point is valid for our inequality, that refers the graph will be upper part of this line. Otherwise, it will become lower part.

---
As you know to be able to sketch the line of the this kind of equations, we need to have at least two points.

We have another method to solve the mathematical models which is called Table method. Main differences between this and graphical method are:
1) Graphical method can be only used whenever there are only two decision variables. However, for Table method, there is no limit for this.
2) Graphical method can be used to find both max and min (if defined). However, table method can find only max value.
3) Table method can solve the models whenever objective function P = a*x1+b*x2 <= n. If that is >=, we cannot use this method here.

ðŸ”¹ **Slack variables** are **extra variables** added to **â‰¤ (less than or equal to) constraints** in a linear programming problem to **convert inequalities into equalities**. They represent the **unused resources** in a constraint.

ðŸ”¹ In the **table method** (Simplex Method), slack variables help **form the initial tableau** for solving the problem.

---

### **Why Do We Use Slack Variables?**

- The **Simplex Method** requires equations, but constraints like 3*x + 2y <= 10 are **inequalities**.
- By adding a **slack variable**, we transform the inequality into an **equation**.

---

### **Example: Converting Constraints with Slack Variables**

Consider the constraint:

3*x + 2y <= 10

We introduce a **slack variable** s1s_1 (representing the unused portion of the resource) and rewrite it as:

3x+2y+s1=10

where s1â‰¥0

- If s1=0 â†’ The resource is fully used.
- If s1>0 â†’ Some resource is left unused.

After getting system using slack variables, we will solve this. The results come from here are called **basic solutions**. If all values in a basic solution are non-negative, that means this is **basic feasible solution**.
In the **basic feasible solutions**, the variables which are equal to 0 are **nonbasic variables** and the others (different than 0) are **basic variables**.

### **Steps to solve models using Table method**

- Using slack variables, we will get the system of linear equations.
- We will create a table, where there should be ( (m + 2) * (m + 1) / 2 ) rows and (m + 2) columns. Here m is the number of contraint functions. 
	Imagine we have two constraints: x1+2*x2<=32; 3*x1+4*x2<=84; x1, x2>=0 and P=50*x1+80*x2
		
In table for each row, we need to put 2 zeros in each combination. For each row, according to these, we will calculate other variables.
For the first column we put 0 for x1 and x2 and find s1 and so on...

| x1  | x2  | s1  | s2  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |     |     |
| 0   |     | 0   |     |
| 0   |     |     | 0   |
|     | 0   | 0   |     |
|     | 0   |     | 0   |
|     |     | 0   | 0   |

- For the case when there is undefined equality or an equality with infinite solution, we will not write this row in the table. 
- After calculating main variables, we put the rows(with nonnegative variables) in objective function and find max value.

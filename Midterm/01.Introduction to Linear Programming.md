Linear Programming (LP) is a method used to **find the best solution** to a problem where you have **limited resources** (like time, money, or materials) and need to **maximize or minimize** something (like profit, cost, or efficiency).

💡 Think of it like **choosing the best way to do something while following some rules**.

### **Example 1: Bakery Problem 🍞**

Imagine you own a bakery that makes **cakes** and **cookies**. You want to **maximize profit**, but you have limited ingredients:

- You have **5 kg of flour** and **10 kg of sugar**.
- A **cake** needs **2 kg flour + 3 kg sugar** and gives **$5 profit**.
- A **cookie** needs **1 kg flour + 2 kg sugar** and gives **$3 profit**.

Now, you need to decide:  
✔️ How many cakes and cookies should you make to get the highest profit **without running out of ingredients**?

🔹 We turn this into a **mathematical model** using **linear equations** and solve it!

### **How Does Linear Programming Work?**

1. **Define Decision Variables** → What are we choosing?
    
    - Let **x** = number of cakes
    - Let **y** = number of cookies
2. **Objective Function** → What are we maximizing or minimizing?

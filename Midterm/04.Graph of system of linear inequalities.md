Using the graphs of the linear equalities, we can sketch their system's graph:
1) We just need to sketch the lines for their equalities.
2) Then to find their intersection part.
3) The best way is to number each region. Then for each inequality, we need to write as et of proper regions and then find the intersection of them. This part will be the graph of linear inequalities.

We will use their graphical sketch to solve linear models. The important parts of the graph is whether it is restricted (if yes, from lower or upper part or both) and its edges.
